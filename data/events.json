      "title": "Security Council LIVE: UN raises alarm over deadly Iran protests and ‘possible military strikes’",
      "description": "The UN Security Council is meeting in New York in emergency session on Iran, amid escalating concern over reports that hundreds have been killed during weeks of nationwide anti-government protests. The meeting was requested by the United States. Demonstrations that began in late December, fuelled by soaring inflation, rising food prices and the collapse of the national currency, triggered a deadly and widespread crackdown with thousands injured and detained, according to numerous firsthand accounts. The UN has called for independent investigations into all killings and warned against the possible use of the death penalty against protesters.

      "description": "Flood warning raised to highest level with roads washed away and rain forcing evacuation of Kruger national park Large areas of north-eastern South Africa and neighbouring Mozambique have been inundated for several days with exceptionally heavy rainfall. Some locations in South Africa recorded hundreds of millimetres of rain over the weekend, such as Graskop in Mpumalanga, where 113mm fell in 24 hours, and Phalaborwa, which recorded about 85mm of rainfall. Rain has continued to fall across the region since the weekend. The deluge has been driven by a slow-moving cut-off low pressure system that has remained anchored over the region, repeatedly drawing in moisture and triggering intense downpours. Further heavy rainfall is expected on Friday and over the weekend. Maputo, Mozambique’s capital, could expect daily rainfall totals to exceed 200mm by the end of Friday, while western parts of South Africa and north-western Eswatini may record more than 100mm.

He offers a rare quantified data-driven-account of fatalities in the current Iranian uprising, grounded in documented evidence and firsthand reporting. Against a backdrop of an Internet blackout and brutal state repression, Professor Amiry-Moghaddam situates the crisis not only as a statistical tragedy but as a lived reality inside Iran, where digital communication itself carries a heightened lethal risk. He bridges rigorous documentation with broader questions about international law and the responsibilities of global actors amidst widespread allegations of serious human rights violations.",
