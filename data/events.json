      "title": "Security Council LIVE: UN raises alarm over deadly Iran protests and ‘possible military strikes’",
      "description": "The UN Security Council is meeting in New York in emergency session on Iran, amid escalating concern over reports that hundreds have been killed during weeks of nationwide anti-government protests. The meeting was requested by the United States. Demonstrations that began in late December, fuelled by soaring inflation, rising food prices and the collapse of the national currency, triggered a deadly and widespread crackdown with thousands injured and detained, according to numerous firsthand accounts. The UN has called for independent investigations into all killings and warned against the possible use of the death penalty against protesters.

      "description": "Flood warning raised to highest level with roads washed away and rain forcing evacuation of Kruger national park Large areas of north-eastern South Africa and neighbouring Mozambique have been inundated for several days with exceptionally heavy rainfall. Some locations in South Africa recorded hundreds of millimetres of rain over the weekend, such as Graskop in Mpumalanga, where 113mm fell in 24 hours, and Phalaborwa, which recorded about 85mm of rainfall. Rain has continued to fall across the region since the weekend. The deluge has been driven by a slow-moving cut-off low pressure system that has remained anchored over the region, repeatedly drawing in moisture and triggering intense downpours. Further heavy rainfall is expected on Friday and over the weekend. Maputo, Mozambique’s capital, could expect daily rainfall totals to exceed 200mm by the end of Friday, while western parts of South Africa and north-western Eswatini may record more than 100mm.

      "description": "It’s been a week marked by brutality, brinkmanship and political theatre. In Iran, a third week of protests spiralled into a nationwide uprising as the regime shut down the internet and phone lines. Graphic accounts of a violent crackdown emerged via Elon Musk’s Starlink satellites, with human rights groups reporting thousands killed by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard in what they describe as an unprecedented massacre — even as President Trump urged protesters on, before appearing to shift his tone. Meanwhile, urgent diplomacy unfolded in the Arctic, as Denmark and Greenland pushed back against renewed US pressure to annex Greenland. President Trump insists America “needs” the island for strategic defence, prompting European allies to boost NATO’s presence — and leaving Greenland’s leadership confronting an unsettling new reality. And across Europe, politics turned volatile. France’s minority government survived two no-confidence votes sparked by anger over the EU’s Mercosur trade deal, as farmers clogged the country with tractor protests. In the UK, a dramatic defection saw a senior Conservative sacked and swiftly unveiled by Nigel Farage’s Reform party, while Prime Minister Keir Starmer added fresh bite to his rhetoric.",

Her voice, urgent and unwavering, challenges the international community, including the UN Security Council, to rise up and take action in the face of \"crimes against humanity.\" Ms. Tavakoli’s testimony underscores the deepening fracture between global democratic ideals and geopolitical pragmatism, raising uncomfortable questions about complicity, silence, and selective outrage.

European countries do appear to be taking this latest threat seriously, but can they actually stop Trump from taking over Greenland?
