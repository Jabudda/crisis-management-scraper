      "description": "At least 16 files disappeared from the US Department of Justice’s public webpage containing documents related to Jeffrey Epstein less than a day after they were posted, including a file featuring a photograph connected to former President Donald Trump. The removals occurred without any explanation from the government or notice to the public. Trump has consistently denied any knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and has said he distanced himself from his former friend years ago. Being named or included in the files does not imply wrongdoing. The unexplained removals have sparked anger among politicians, as well as victims of the late sex offender and their families. Morgan Ayre has the details.",
