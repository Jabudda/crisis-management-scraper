McKenzie spoke to ABC News this morning, just before party leader David Littleproud is set to speak amid the fallout. She said: Obviously, Sussan Ley has chosen to accept our resignations and the consequence of that is the National party broader shadow ministry has also tended their resignation to the opposition leader. And now, obviously, that’s a matter for her and David to discuss the fallout. … We took this as a very serious and principled decision as a party room. … But ultimately, we did not have the comfort we needed around the hate laws … and our room, with a heavy heart, made the decision. As my dad used to say, for every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction. And I would call for calmer heads to prevail, because we are Coalitionists. We need to do everything we can to confront hate preachers and those that spread vile antisemitism and racism in our community and this law helps us do that. So I’m glad it’s in place, I think it’s important that it was supported. They’re really important in terms of keeping the public safe.
