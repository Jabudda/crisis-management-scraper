      "description": "While Mali's campaign at the African Cup of Nations has ended, their 1-0 loss against Senegal would have been much heavier if it wasn't for their goalkeeper's fantastic saves when the Eagles were reduced to 10 men. Djigui Diarra had already impressed in their penalty shootout against Tunisia and his performances are set to be one of the highlights of this tournament.",

      "description": "The host nation outclassed Cameroon and provided new hope to fans as they sealed a convincing 2-0 win against the Indomitable Lions. Brahim Diaz and Ismael Saibari found the net either side of half time, however Cameroon were unable to cause any harm up front. Senegal meanwhile needed just a single goal courtesy of Iliman Ndiaye to beat a 10-man Mali side, whose Yves Bissouma was sent off after picking up a second yellow card. We also take a look at Saturday's other quarter-finals, where Algeria will take on Nigeria and seven-time champions Egypt will face defending champions Ivory Coast.",
