      "description": "On January 14, the FBI raided the home of Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson as part of an investigation into a government contractor's handling of classified material. It is not illegal for a reporter in the United States to publish classified material, so the search has raised numerous concerns. In particular, free speech advocates say the dramatic raid could have a chilling effect on reporters and sources. Our guest is Marty Baron, a highly-regarded former editor of The Washington Post.",

We believe in the coalition and we would like to see a coalition continue, but the circumstances around the actions of the National party this week left the leader with no option but to accept the resignations of three people who, by their own admission, broke the very fundamental rule of a coalition and that is shadow cabinet solidarity.
